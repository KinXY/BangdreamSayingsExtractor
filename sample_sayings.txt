Others: "Wh-what are you saying? Don't you remember what it is we did all of that practicing for?"
Yukina: "Roselia exists to bring out of us the best music that we can possibly create...",

Others: "... Ah! ... I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone else was here."
Yukina: "I watched you perform up there today.",

Others: "... Even if you keep practicing, you won't be able to sing it like you did before."
Yukina: "How do you know that...?",

Others: "Roselia is a band that the five of us formed."
Yukina: "So I was worried about what would happen if we involved other people in it too...",

Others: "You think so? I could never be better than you two."
Yukina: "Someday, I wanna be just as good as daddy, but I'm not sure how to do that.",

Others: "And we still haven't found anyone to play keyboard..."
Yukina: "It's incredible enough that we four managed to get together in such a short time. I don't want to make compromises just to get a fifth.",

Others: "Y-you're welcome! By the way, we'd love to go to another one of Roselia's concerts!"
Yukina: "Yeah... That'd be nice.",

Others: "... I..."
Yukina: "...",

Others: "S-so what do you think?! How do you feel about debuting under our agency?"
Yukina: "...",

Others: "Hmm? Ako? What are you doing here?"
Yukina: "... Do you know her, Lisa?",

Others: "This song is crucial for Roselia's future... We will perform it as well as we have previously..."
Yukina: "No, we must do so. That is how we will reach the future we have chosen for ourselves...",

Others: "My superiors said that they're sure it would gain a lot of press and reach people who have never even heard of Roselia...!"
Yukina: "...",

Others: "It's true. The whole band has improved well, in such a short time, too. That goes for you too, Ako, Rinko."
Yukina: "If we are to go forward together, the five of us... Ako, Rinko... Lisa. It's time we told you about our goal.",

Others: "...~♪"
Yukina: "...",

Others: "......"
Yukina: "......",

Others: "I thought I felt a strange kind of synergy..."
Yukina: "Okay. Ako, Rinko-san... and Lisa. We will try performing live at our next event, the five of us.",

Others: "Not at all! I think it's a great goal!"
Yukina: "...!",

Others: "No, that is not it. I just wanted to ask all of your opinions once again."
Yukina: "We have previously discussed what path we think Roselia should proceed down...",

Others: "Minato-san. Does Imai-san have experience playing the bass guitar?"
Yukina: "She does. I think she should still be able to perform the basics.",

Others: "Nothing's gotten into me. If you can't live up to this band's standards, you will be removed. This is something I've been saying since the very beginning."
Yukina: "... Ako! The tempo is all over the place.",

Others: "In that case, perhaps it is Kirigaya-san that you should be thanking."
Yukina: "You mentioned that you occasionally give her guitar lessons, but does that have some connection with this?",

Others: "They do say this event is like a gateway to success for local bands like ours. But we're not exactly looking for a break like this..."
Yukina: "She's right. We have our sights set much higher than that. A major debut is not everything. And we don't need anyone who doesn't think the same, Ako.",

Others: "Everyone has their issues. The reason we hold on to them is because we can't let go. All we can do is keep moving on... right?"
Yukina: "... Sayo...",

Others: "... I was so surprised. I never thought you would say something like that, Yukina."
Yukina: "Was it really that surprising?",

Others: "That's right. And with the way you're crying about something so insignificant, I can see exactly where you're headed."
Yukina: "If you're gonna act like a spoiled brat, then you don't belong in this band.",

Others: "I was nervous since we have not participated in that event before, but I am glad that we all did our very best."
Yukina: "Being more thorough than usual during set-up was the correct decision. I think the outcome was better than I had expected.",

Others: "It's been so long~. It feels good to breathe this studio air again☆ I haven't been here since, what, 8th grade?"
Yukina: "7th. Have you forgotten already? You spent your whole 8th grade summer at the beach.",

Others: "We've already decided the road we're going down, haven't we, Yukina?"
Yukina: "Yes, so let's go down it. Toward the shining future of Roselia...!",

Others: "... Oh, right. The outro on our last song, my chord change came in too late. I truly apologize for ruining the performance."
Yukina: "...! You're right, it was a little late. I don't think anyone noticed, though.",

Others: "(I do not particularly wish for Roselia to be a band that is supported by the masses...)"
Yukina: "Is there light down this road...?",

Others: "She's called Yukina, and she really is one of the coolest people ever! I just know as soon as you hear her voice, you'll be hooked just like me!"
Yukina: "......",

Others: "Okay~! I'll just have to practice like crazy, then~!"
Yukina: "Once we have our members, we'll be entering a contest to perform at Future World Fes. Do you understand?",

Others: "If debuting under a major label requires you to sacrifice your determination and beliefs... then that would mean now is not the time for Roselia to debut."
Yukina: "Sayo...",

Others: "Isn't that the reason most people even make bands anyway?"
Yukina: "If I can sing well...",

Others: "Yes, see you."
Yukina: "We should get going too once we have finished cleaning up these flyers. I shall further research the events we picked out later.",

Others: "S-sorry, sorry! We were just doing some pre-show chanting to psyche ourselves up☆ I wish you two would have joined us~."
Yukina: "That's enough. You should ready yourselves long before you arrive, otherwise we are all in trouble.",

Others: "Yes, we are still deciding on our direction as a band from here on-"
Yukina: "Wait.",

Others: "(If we cannot express those feelings, then we cannot play this song.)"
Yukina: "(I understand this... and yet, I cannot sing it like I used to...)",

Others: "......"
Yukina: "The whole band has improved well, in such a short time, too. That goes for you too, Ako, Rinko.",

Others: "Maybe it's because I see myself even more as a part of this band now. Sometimes I even imagine the future of our band."
Yukina: "I see...",

Others: "......"
Yukina: "(I am going to become bigger than he ever was and... I am going to make him smile again...)",

Others: "Welp, can't really do much about that. No problem! We can take our time once we're done with the concert♪"
Yukina: "Everyone, I've done some thinking about our set list for SMS. Take a look.",

Others: "The same is true for you."
Yukina: "For me...?",

Others: "What happened to Yukina-san...?"
Yukina: "(We have to bring it all back...)",

Others: "Welp, can't really do much about that. No problem! We can take our time once we're done with the concert♪"
Yukina: "I appreciate you putting that off. I believe we'll need to increase our rehearsal time in preparation for this.",

Others: "(... I don't... ... I don't know what to do, either...)"
Yukina: "I... I have to join the festival! For my father! I've always said as much, haven't I?!",

Others: "...! And why's that?! Because I'm not good enough?"
Yukina: "That's right. And with the way you're crying about something so insignificant, I can see exactly where you're headed.",

Others: "I understand. I'll wait as long as you need to come up with an answer. I'll see you again."
Yukina: "... Okay.",

Others: "(I am going to become bigger than he ever was and... I am going to make him smile again...)"
Yukina: "That's why... I don't have time for worries...!",

Others: "..."
Yukina: "There is no need to apologize. If there is a problem, we only need fix it. That is what practice is for, is it not?",

Others: "There's no need to rush anyway. Let's find our own way at our own pace."
Yukina: "... You are right. If this is what you have all decided, then I too will not regret this decision.",

Others: "(Dad threw away all of his old music magazines... but I managed to keep hold of just one...)"
Yukina: "......",

Others: "Yeah! That's why I don't wanna lose to them! We've gotta show the world how cool Roselia is!"
Yukina: "... I see. What do you think, Rinko?",

Others: "... Friends? You don't need instruments, studios, and live houses to make friends. You can chat amongst yourselves in a cafe, like regular school kids."
Yukina: "(... She thinks just like me. A high school student, too...)",

Others: "Yukina. Is it true? Is all of it true?"
Yukina: "So what if it is?",

Others: "Anything that is necessary for Roselia is not something I would hesitate to do."
Yukina: "I believe that is how it has been up until now.",

Others: "You remember our last performance, don't you? It's obvious we still have something we're lacking."
Yukina: "When something is inadequate, you make it adequate. That's all there is to it. This goes especially for you, Ako. If you don't refine your skills, you will fall behind.",

Others: "The junior division... We'd only be opening for the pros to follow, but the event rivals Future World Fes itself. We have to get focused and prepare ourselves."
Yukina: "Certainly. Let's make this a performance that'll bring us closer to Future World Fes.",

Others: "Minato-san, may I ask you one thing first?"
Yukina: "What is it?",

Others: "I don't know!"
Yukina: "I don't know what else we could possibly do! And I can't figure out any other way... That's why...!",

Others: "No, I guess we haven't..."
Yukina: "I can see CiRCLE. We must properly prepare for tomorrow's show.",

Others: "Roselia's Drummer of Darkness is ready to give it all she's got, too! Roselia... It's such a cool sounding name... How did you come up with it, by the way?"
Yukina: "It's a rose and a camellia. A blue rose, to be specific... ... That is my image of our band...",

Others: "Can you see... a path of blue roses leading to your future now, Yukina?"
Yukina: "Yes, I believe I can see a light at the end of this tunnel.",

Others: "Y-yeah. You're right..."
Yukina: "Now, let's go home before it gets late.",

Others: "Ah, right. If we're going to talk more about this, I should get you to come to the agency. I'll contact you soon about the date."
Yukina: "Okay, please do.",

Others: "Mmm. I guess you're right. Thanks for the chat! I feel better getting it all off my chest. I'm gonna go get some dinner. See ya☆"
Yukina: "......",

Others: "I'm guessing it means that "LOUDER" is a very important song to you all, right?"
Yukina: "That song is proof of my father's unachieved dream.",

Others: "A-ahaha... My bad. I was just so happy, it got the best of me."
Yukina: "I, too, am pleased to have someone come directly to us and ask us to participate in SMS. The other members and I can also sense the overall better mood that surrounds the band.",

Others: "Udagawa-san, Imai-san. This is a public area. Try to have a little more decorum."
Yukina: "Excuse me. Could I make another studio reservation?",

Others: "That means I would be- I must not stop everyone's progress."
Yukina: "Just as you all lent me your strength... to make the dream my father could not achieve come true...",

Others: "(What is this feeling...? I... I don't think I've ever felt this... This at peace before...)"
Yukina: "(... I have no thoughts, my mind is clear... All I need is to sing...)",

Others: "Shh, she'll hear you. She's not the type to forgive that talk, either."
Yukina: "......",

Others: "Yukina~☆ I was just about to go check out that new accessory store. Do you wanna come-"
Yukina: "Not interested. ... Early start tonight. I need to hurry.",

Others: "Yes. Thanks to you, my mindset has changed."
Yukina: "Just as I thought, you always lead those who are lost.",

Others: "I knew that entering a new world would mean that something would change. I thought that would perhaps be the fulfilling time we spend on our music."
Yukina: "That is why I did not reveal my true feelings to you all. As you saw our future in this new world.",

Others: "You were already so good at singing, and I... I had to practice so hard to keep up with you... But it was always so much fun..."
Yukina: "I don't want to hear about the past. I have to go... I have things to do.",

Others: "That's right! Yukina-san, you'll hurt your throat if you keep singing like this!"
Yukina: "You need not worry, I am fine. Let's continue.",

Others: "W-we have...?"
Yukina: "Yes, the way you both interpret music and focus during performances has improved.",

Others: "Yes!"
Yukina: "... Sayo... Everyone...",

Others: "That is it! I cannot be in this band with her any more!"
Yukina: "...!",

Others: "(Moca and Ran will be fine, I'm sure. But me... I have to go and make things right.)"
Yukina: "(A message from the agency... I know I should read it, but...)",

Others: "(It's possible that the answer I've been looking for lies within that "something" that I felt when I heard Toyama-san and the others play...)"
Yukina: "(Maybe, without realizing it, I came here looking for that answer.)",

Others: "So you're finally starting up a band~. I was starting to get worried, you never seem to hang out with anyone other than me~."
Yukina: "Lisa... I really am serious about this. Sayo and I share the same goal, of playing the Future World Fes. That's why we've come together.",

Others: "So how was the test, Yukina? Do you wanna hear my results? Do you?"
Yukina: "...... I have more important things on my mind right now.",

Others: "(The road ahead wasn't clear to me though. Somewhere, in the corner of my heart, I continued to feel as if something was off about my sentiment toward singing...)"
Yukina: "(Now I might be able to say I like it, just a little bit.)",

Others: "..."
Yukina: "(What was it about today's performance that made the audience leave?)",

Others: "What exactly... is different...?"
Yukina: "... Now, let's start from two measures back.",

Others: "What do you mean, exactly?"
Yukina: "I didn't fully understand my own feelings. I didn't fully understand the relationship we all have together. And I apologize for that.",

Others: "Yukina-san...!"
Yukina: "Ako, Rinko...",

Others: "...? Yukina? What are you staring at?"
Yukina: "... The stage we are going to stand on today.",

Others: "It was not just you. Lisa, Rinko, and Ako all had reasons to go down this road."
Yukina: "That means I would be- I must not stop everyone's progress.",

Others: "I'm serious. This is everything to me. I'm going to make the perfect band. Fun and enjoyment have nothing to do with it."
Yukina: "Here's the live house. Aren't you going to the accessory store?",

Others: "Yukina-senpai~!!"
Yukina: "Toyama-san, nicely done.",

Others: "You know, I thought music agencies would be much more uptight..."
Yukina: "It seems they are more flexible than I had thought.",

Others: "In that case, Harumi-san is just the person for us!"
Yukina: "...",

Others: "But still, the accessory store's right by the live house, right? I'm just saying we could at least walk there together♪"
Yukina: "......",

Others: "The... next song...?"
Yukina: "Is something the matter?",

Others: "Solo practice?"
Yukina: "... I still don't know how to restore Roselia, so I came to sing... But it seems like that was pointless.",

Others: "......"
Yukina: "Ah...",

Others: "(This band... The guitarist is great. The rest aren't worth mentioning. Their whole balance is off...)"
Yukina: "(... But that girl... Her phrasing is one thing, but even the basics are far beyond normal skill...)"
